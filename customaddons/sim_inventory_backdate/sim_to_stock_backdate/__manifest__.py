The problem
===========
In Odoo, when you carry out stock & inventory operations such as validating a stock transfer, doing inventory adjustment, creating scrap,
Odoo applies the current date and time for the move automatically which is sometimes not what you want. For example,
when you were inputting data for the past operations or when you start a new Odoo implementation that requires data from the past.

The solution
============
This module gives you a chance to input your desired date in the past. The following operations are currently supported with backdate

1. Stock Transfer

   During validation of stock transfers, when you click on Validate button, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime.

2. Inventory Adjustment

   When validating an inventory adjustment, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime, in case you don't want backdate operation.

3. Stock Scrapping

   During validating a scrap from either a stock transfer or a standalone scrap order, a new window will be popped out with a datetime field for your input.
   The default value for the field is the current datetime.

The backdate you input will also be used for accounting entry's date if the product is configured with automated stock valuation.
It supports all available costing methods in Odoo (i.e. Standard Costing, Average Costing, FIFO Costing)

Backdate Operations Control
---------------------------

By default, only users in the "Inventory / Manager" group can carry out backdate operations in Inventory application.
Other users must be granted to the access group **Backdate Operations** before she or he can do it.

Known issues
------------

- Since the acounting journal entry's Date field does not contain time, the backdate in accounting may not respect user's timezone,
  and may causes visual discrepancy between stock move's date and accounting date. This is also an issue by Odoo that can be reproduced as below
  
  * assume that your timezone is UTC+7
  * validate a stock transfer at your local time between 00:00 and 07:00
  * go to the corresponding accounting journal entry to find its date could be 1 day earlier than the stock transfer's date
